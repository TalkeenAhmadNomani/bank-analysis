## SOME insight using EDA

# Deposits and Savings Behavior
A strong correlation exists between Bank Deposits and Saving Accounts.

Indicates either overlapping financial behavior or that customers who deposit more tend to maintain/grow savings.

# Income, Age, and Accumulation
Moderate correlations of Age and Estimated Income with:

Superannuation Funds

Savings Balances

Credit Card or Loan Amounts

Suggests that older individuals or high-income earners accumulate more assets and sometimes take larger credits.

# Properties Owned: Weak Correlation
Low correlation between properties owned and banking balances.

Implies external factors (real estate market, inheritance, region) drive property ownership more than bank account metrics.

# Business vs Personal Banking
Moderate link between Business Lending and Bank Loans â€” some customers likely engage in both.

However, Business Lending is largely independent of deposit-related variables, indicating a distinct customer segment.
